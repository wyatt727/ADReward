# Phase 4 Implementation Report - Developer Tools

## 1. Overview

Phase 4 implements key developer tools for ADReward, including live watch mode and diff-mode reporting. These tools significantly enhance the developer experience by providing real-time feedback and comparison capabilities. This phase builds on the architectural foundation laid in previous phases, particularly leveraging the plugin architecture from Phase 3.

## 2. Live Watch / Hot-Reload Implementation

### 2.1 Watch Module

We implemented a watch system using the `chokidar` library to monitor changes to generated Frida scripts and automatically reload them:

```typescript
export async function watchFridaScript(options: WatchOptions): Promise<() => void> {
  const supportsReload = await fridaSupportsReload();
  
  // Set up watcher with chokidar
  const watcher = chokidar.watch(scriptPath, {
    persistent: true,
    ignoreInitial: true
  });
  
  // Start initial Frida process
  // Listen for file changes
  watcher.on('change', async (path) => {
    // Reload or restart Frida process
  });
}
```

### 2.2 Frida Version Detection

The implementation includes version detection to determine whether to use the `--reload` flag (available in Frida v16+) or to restart the process for older versions:

```typescript
async function fridaSupportsReload(): Promise<boolean> {
  const { stdout } = await execPromise('frida --version');
  const version = parseInt(stdout.trim().split('.')[0], 10);
  return version >= 16;
}
```

### 2.3 CLI Integration

The watch mode is activated through the new `--watch` flag, which requires `--gen-script`:

```typescript
program.option('--watch', 'Watch generated script and auto-reload Frida on changes', false);
```

When enabled, the CLI enters a persistent mode that continues running until explicitly terminated with Ctrl+C.

## 3. Diff-Mode Reporter Implementation

### 3.1 Diff Computation

We implemented a comprehensive component diff system using the `deep-diff` library to identify:

1. Added hooks (present in new but not in old)
2. Removed hooks (present in old but not in new)
3. Changed hooks (present in both but with property differences)
4. Unchanged hooks (identical in both)

```typescript
export async function diffComponents(
  oldComponents: ComponentMap,
  newComponents: ComponentMap,
  options: DiffOptions = {}
): Promise<DiffStats> {
  // Use deep-diff to compare component maps
  // Process results into added/removed/changed/unchanged categories
}
```

### 3.2 Formatted Output

The diff report includes colorized terminal output with comprehensive statistics:

```
=== Hook Component Diff ===

Family: admob
+ Added: 1
- Removed: 1
~ Changed: 0
= Unchanged: 1

Added hooks:
  + com.example.game.ads.NewAdMobHandler.processReward

Removed hooks:
  - com.example.game.ads.AdMobManager.handleReward
```

### 3.3 CLI Command

We implemented a new `diff` command for comparing scan results:

```typescript
program
  .command('diff')
  .description('Compare two component JSON files')
  .argument('<old-file>', 'Path to old components JSON file')
  .argument('<new-file>', 'Path to new components JSON file')
  .option('--show-unchanged', 'Show unchanged items', false)
  .option('-o, --output <path>', 'Save diff to file')
  .action(async (oldFile, newFile, options) => {
    // Generate and display diff
  });
```

## 4. Automatic Scan Results Storage

To facilitate comparing results over time, we implemented automatic JSON storage for scan results:

```typescript
if (options.saveResults !== false) {
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '-');
  const outputDir = path.join(path.dirname(dexDir), 'scan-results');
  await fs.mkdir(outputDir, { recursive: true });
  
  const outputPath = path.join(outputDir, `components-${timestamp}.json`);
  await fs.writeFile(outputPath, JSON.stringify(results, null, 2));
}
```

Results are stored in `./analysis/<package>/scan-results/` with timestamps for easy tracking and comparison.

## 5. Enhanced CLI Options

We added new options to the CLI to support the new functionality:

- `--watch`: Enable watch mode for live reloading
- `--save-results`: Save scan results to JSON files (enabled by default)
- `--show-unchanged`: Show unchanged hooks in diff output
- `--output`: Save diff results to a file

## 6. Documentation Updates

We updated the README.md with clear instructions for using the new features:

```
### Live Watch / Hot-Reload

```bash
adreward --package com.example.app --gen-script --watch
```

### Diff-Mode Reporting

```bash
adreward diff ./analysis/scan-results/components-old.json ./analysis/scan-results/components-new.json
```
```

## 7. Benefits and Improvements

### 7.1 Workflow Enhancements

- **Live Development**: Developers can edit Frida scripts and immediately see the effects without manual reloading
- **Version Tracking**: Components can be compared across app versions to identify changes in ad implementation
- **Historical Analysis**: Timestamped component maps provide an audit trail of changes

### 7.2 User Experience

- **Clear Feedback**: Colorized diff output makes it easy to identify changes
- **Seamless Integration**: Watch mode integrates with existing debugging workflows
- **Version Adaption**: Automatic adaptation to Frida version capabilities

### 7.3 Development Efficiency

- **Faster Iterations**: Reduced development time through live reloading
- **Better Analysis**: Improved ability to track changes and identify patterns
- **Collaboration**: Enhanced sharing of results through formatted reports

## 8. Testing

Tested the implementation with the following scenarios:

1. **Watch Mode**: Verified Frida script auto-reloading on both v16+ and older Frida versions
2. **Diff Command**: Tested comparing component files with various changes
3. **Result Storage**: Confirmed automatic saving of scan results in the correct format
4. **Integration**: Validated that all new features work together with the existing pipeline

## 9. Conclusion

Phase 4 successfully implements development tools that significantly enhance the workflow for users working with the ADReward tool. The live watch mode and diff reporting features address key pain points in the development process, allowing for faster iteration and better analysis of ad implementations across app versions.

These improvements align with the project's overall goal of making ad analysis more efficient and accessible, while also providing a foundation for the upcoming phases focused on REST API integration and UI development.
