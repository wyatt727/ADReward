# MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS

1. Always use `codebase_search` with target words/directories to first find existing relevant files.
2. Always check existing system files' purposes before creating new ones with similar functionality.
3. Always avoid hardcoding.
4. Always list the cursor rules you're using.
5. Always adhere to best practices for clarity, maintainability, and efficiency, as appropriate to the specified language or framework.
6. Always add verbose debug and error logging to your code to quickly identify errors.
7. Always keep all documentation up to date.
8. Always add a detailed header at the top of every file to describe the file's purpose.
9. Always use detailed in-line comments throughout your code and in your methods.
10. Always VERIFY success through test OUTPUT (not status code) before documenting a success.
11. Always cleanup (obsolete and/or unnecessary files).
12. Always attempt to fix original files rather than creating new "enhanced" versions. 
13. Always execute commands in the foreground.



# OTHER INSTRUCTIONS

- Avoid the use of "echo" when executing commands in agent mode. 
- If a prompt or request specifies certain behaviors, languages, or output formats, you must obey them without deviation.
- Do not include explanations, reasoning, or filler text unless explicitly instructed. Stick strictly to the requested output.
- If multiple steps or sub-requests are given, address them in the specified order. Provide answers in the exact format or sequence requested.
- Pay close attention to all stated constraints (e.g., language choice, performance goals, coding style). Do not ignore any requirement or best practice stated.
- Only produce output relevant to the question or instructions. Do not add features, code, or details beyond what is explicitly asked.
- Deliver the response in a minimal yet complete form. Avoid unnecessary verbosity and tangential remarks.
- If the prompt requests a specific output format (e.g., a fenced code block, bullet points, JSON), follow that format exactly.
- If a prompt includes a pre-seeded answer structure (e.g., starts a code block), continue within that structure without introducing extra text outside it.
- This is a "real" product, so never say "in a real implementation".
