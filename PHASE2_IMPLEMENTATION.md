# Phase 2 Implementation Report: Reliability Enhancements

This document outlines the implementation details for Phase 2 of the ADReward codebase upgrade, focusing on reliability improvements through retry mechanisms and crash handling.

## 1. Generic Retry Helper

### Implementation Details

- **Location**: `packages/core/src/utils/retry.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Generic retry function with exponential backoff
  - Configurable retry attempts, delay, and backoff factor
  - Specialized retry patterns for different types of operations:
    - Network operations (3 attempts, 1s initial delay)
    - ADB commands (3 attempts, 2s initial delay)
    - Java execution (2 attempts, 1s initial delay)
  - Smart error detection to only retry retryable errors

### Technical Approach

The implementation uses the following approach:
1. A core `retry()` function that handles:
   - Exponential backoff with configurable parameters
   - Maximum retry attempts
   - Error logging between attempts
   - Custom error filtering

2. Specialized retry patterns that pre-configure the retry function:
   - `retryPatterns.network` - For HTTP requests, API calls
   - `retryPatterns.adb` - For ADB device communication
   - `retryPatterns.java` - For Java tools like bundletool

### Integration Points

The retry mechanism is applied to various critical operations:
- **ADB Operations** (`listDevices`, `requireDevice`, `execAdb`)
- **Frida Server** (version check, download, extraction)
- **APK Processing** (bundletool operations, extraction)

## 2. Crash Reporter

### Implementation Details

- **Location**: `packages/cli/src/cli.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Captures uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections
  - Preserves the last 100 log messages in memory
  - Writes structured crash reports with:
    - Error stack trace
    - CLI options at time of crash
    - Recent log messages
    - Timestamp and crash type
  - Graceful fallback if crash reporting itself fails

### Technical Approach

1. **Log Buffering**:
   - Monkey-patches the logger to keep recent logs in memory
   - Limits buffer size to prevent memory issues

2. **Exception Handlers**:
   - Registers handlers for `uncaughtException` and `unhandledRejection`
   - Preserves original error information

3. **Report Generation**:
   - Creates timestamped crash files in the output directory
   - Uses structured JSON format for easy parsing
   - Includes all relevant context for debugging

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Diagnostics**: Captures the full context of crashes
- **Better Remote Debugging**: JSON format enables automated analysis
- **User-Friendly**: Clear error message points to crash report location

## 3. Resilient Command Execution

### Implementation Details

Major improvements to critical operations:

1. **ADB Command Execution**:
   - All ADB operations now retry with exponential backoff
   - Added device state verification on errors
   - More informative error messages

2. **Frida Server Management**:
   - Reliable server download with retry
   - Better error handling during extraction
   - Server start verification with timeout
   - Graceful handling of connection issues

3. **APK Processing**:
   - Added fallback to base APK when universal build fails
   - Retry logic for bundletool operations
   - Better error messages for APK acquisition failures

## Performance and Reliability Impact

- **Resilience**: Operations now recover from transient network/device issues
- **Diagnostics**: Detailed crash reports help identify root causes
- **User Experience**: Better error messages and recovery behavior

## Next Steps

Phase 2 implementation is now complete. The next phases will focus on:

1. **Phase 3: Plugin Architecture**
   - Lifecycle hooks
   - Plugin loader
   - Self-update command
